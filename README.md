# no-npm

Npm@5+ is still ugly, isn't it?

no-npm prevents running the <kbd>npm</kbd> in the `yarn.lock`-based projects.

Just add it as dev dependency and magic will be done

```sh
yarn add -D no-npm
```

## Jesus, No! npm is the best again!
ok, we're have something for you: **[noyarn](https://github.com/a-x-/noyarn)** ✨
