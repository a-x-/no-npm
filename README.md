# no-npm

Npm@5+ is still ugly, isn't it?

no-npm prevents running the <kbd>npm</kbd> in the `yarn.lock`-based projects.

Just add it as dev dependency and magic will be done

```sh
yarn add -D mpn-on # 😝 npm disallows npm mentions
```

## Jesus, No! npm is the best again!
Good news, we have something special for you: **[noyarn](https://github.com/a-x-/noyarn)** ✨
